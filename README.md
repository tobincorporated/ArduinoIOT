# ArduinoIOT
This is a template I created to allow an Arduino to fetch and post data to a webpage.  It was made to work with the Arduino Uno Wifi shield and uses Meteor and RestAPI to allow the programmer to create a website with data that the Arduino can poll and modify.

This template solved 2 problems that could not be fixed with preexisting solutions:
* Arduino needed to be able to continuously poll and update data online
* The webpage needed to be customizable so that our students could use it as a basis to create their own IoT-driven website
